### Abstract  

Bargaining between buyers and sellers is an activity that has been around since the dawn of civilization. Both parties ideally want low and high prices and try to agree on a price somewhere in between. The large number of decisions that affect the bargaining and the non-deterministic nature of this processâ€™s model, make finding the best solutions difficult and model simulation a slow process. This project made use of prism model simulator to simulate the model and used three different genetic algorithms namely GA,NSGA2 and SPEA2  to find the best decision sets for the buyer-seller model. It also used parallelism and early termination to improve the overall run time of running optimizers on the model.

### Keywords
1. **Prism** : PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or probabilistic behaviour.
2. **GA** : Genetic Algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.
3. **NSGA2** : Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi objective optimization that makes use of multiple frontiers and primary/secondary sorting.
4. **SPEA2** : Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm for multi objective optimization that uses dominance count and an archive,which is a set of good solutions.
5. **Spread** : How distant each point of a population is from its neighbours
6. **IGD** : Distance between the ideal and obtained pareto front.
7. **Hypervolume** : The volume inside the pareto frontiers is called the hypervolume.
8. **DEAP** : Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.
9. **SCOOP** : Scalable COncurrent Operations in Python (SCOOP) is a distributed task module allowing concurrent parallel programming on various environments, from heterogeneous grids to supercomputers.

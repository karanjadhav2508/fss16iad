### Abstract  

Bargaining between buyers and sellers is an activity that has been around since the dawn of civilization. Both parties start off wanting ideally low and high prices and try to agree on a price somewhere in between. The large number of decisions that affect the bargaining and the non-deterministic nature of this processâ€™s model, make finding the best solutions difficult and model simulation a slow process. This project made use of prism model simulator to simulate the model and used three different genetic algorithms namely GA,NSGA2 and SPEA2  to find the best decision sets for the buyer-seller model. It also used parallelism and early termination to improve the overall run time of running optimizers on the model.

### Abstract  

Bargaining between buyers and sellers is an activity that has been around since the dawn of civilization. Both parties ideally want low and high prices and try to agree on a price somewhere in between. The large number of decisions that affect the bargaining and the non-deterministic nature of this process’s model, make finding the best solutions difficult and model simulation a slow process. This project made use of prism model simulator to simulate the model and used three different genetic algorithms namely GA,NSGA2 and SPEA2  to find the best decision sets for the buyer-seller model. It also used parallelism and early termination to improve the overall run time of running optimizers on the model.

### Keywords
1. **Prism** : PRISM is a probabilistic model checker, a tool for formal modelling and analysis of systems that exhibit random or probabilistic behaviour.
2. **GA** : Genetic Algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution.
3. **NSGA2** : Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi objective optimization that makes use of multiple frontiers and primary/secondary sorting.
4. **SPEA2** : Strength pareto evolutionary algorithm for multi objective optimization that uses dominance count and an archive,which is a set of good solutions.
5. **Spread** : How distant each point of a population is from its neighbours
6. **IGD** : Distance between the ideal and obtained pareto front.
7. **Hypervolume** : The volume inside the pareto frontiers.
8. **DEAP** : Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python (DEAP) is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas.
9. **SCOOP** : Scalable COncurrent Operations in Python (SCOOP) is a distributed task module allowing concurrent parallel programming on various environments, from heterogeneous grids to supercomputers. 

### Introduction
The buyer-seller model depends on many decisions such as buyer/seller initial price,reserved price, strategy, time deadline etc and utility value depends on the value at which the buyer and seller agreed for purchase as well as on the time when the agreement was made.The utility value would be higher for purchase value made earlier  The prism  model we used had 15 decisions and generated 3 objectives. The large number of decisions in this model was amajor challenge undertaken in this project as it becomes increasingly difficult to explore the large solution space. In addition to this , the model simulation took several hours to complete due to the simulation overhead caused by prism simulation.This led us to pursue system objective to improve the run time by  using parallelism, load balancing and early termination.

### Background
#### Rubinstein’s Bargaining Model
The bargaining model features alternating offers through an infinite time horizon where two individuals have before them several possible contractual agreements. The standard model has following elements-

1. Two players - Buyer and Seller.
2. Unlimited offers to reach consensus, until one player accepts an offer
3. Alternating offers - first player makes an offer and if second player rejects, the game moves to the next period where second player makes an offer, and so forth.
4. Delays are costly since utility value decreases as time progresses.
